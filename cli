Update the Server (1-2 mins)

"First things first, let’s make sure our EC2 instance is fully up to date. Always update your packages when setting up a new server:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
This command ensures all the latest security patches and updates are installed."

Section 3: Installing Apache Web Server (3-4 mins)

"WordPress needs a web server to run. We’ll use Apache for this setup:

Install Apache:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum install httpd -y
Start Apache and enable it to start on boot:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
Test Apache: Open a browser and navigate to your instance's public IP (http://<Your-Elastic-IP>). If everything is working, you should see the default Apache welcome page.
This confirms that Apache is running and ready to serve web content."

Installing MySQL (MariaDB) (4-5 mins)

"Next, we need a database for WordPress. WordPress uses MySQL to store data, but we’ll install MariaDB, which is a compatible, open-source alternative:

Install MariaDB:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum install mariadb-server -y
Start MariaDB and enable it on boot:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
Secure the MariaDB installation: Run the secure installation script to set a root password and remove unsafe defaults:
bash
Copy code
sudo mysql_secure_installation
When prompted, enter a root password.
Remove anonymous users and test databases for better security.
Disallow remote root login.
Your MySQL setup is now secure and ready for WordPress."

Installing PHP (3-4 mins)

"WordPress is written in PHP, so we need to install PHP and a few necessary extensions:

Install PHP and extensions:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum install php php-mysqlnd php-fpm -y
Restart Apache to load PHP:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart httpd
At this point, our server is capable of processing PHP files, which is key to running WordPress."

Download and Configure WordPress (5-7 mins)

"Now we’re ready to download WordPress and get it configured:

Navigate to the web root directory:
bash
Copy code
cd /var/www/html
Download WordPress:
bash
Copy code
sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
Extract WordPress:
bash
Copy code
sudo tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
Set permissions for the WordPress directory:
bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/wordpress
Create a MySQL database for WordPress:
Log into MariaDB and create a new database and user for WordPress:
bash
Copy code
sudo mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
CREATE USER 'wordpressuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpressuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
Configure WordPress:
Copy the sample configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo cp /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
Open and edit the wp-config.php file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
Update the following lines with your database information:
php
Copy code
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');
define('DB_USER', 'wordpressuser');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_password');
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
Save the file and exit."

Final Steps - Complete Installation in Browser (3-4 mins)

"Now we’re ready to finalize the WordPress installation!

Open your browser and go to http://<Your-Elastic-IP>/wordpress. You should see the WordPress installation wizard.
Complete the installation wizard:
Set your site title, admin username, and password.
Fill in any other details required by the setup process.
Once you complete the wizard, you’ll be taken to the WordPress dashboard, and congratulations, your site is live!"
