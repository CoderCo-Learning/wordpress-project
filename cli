Update the Server (1-2 mins)

"First things first, let’s make sure our EC2 instance is fully up to date. Always update your packages when setting up a new server:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
This command ensures all the latest security patches and updates are installed."

Section 3: Installing Apache Web Server (3-4 mins)

"WordPress needs a web server to run. We’ll use Apache for this setup:

Install Apache:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum install httpd -y
Start Apache and enable it to start on boot:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
Test Apache: Open a browser and navigate to your instance's public IP (http://<Your-Elastic-IP>). If everything is working, you should see the default Apache welcome page.
This confirms that Apache is running and ready to serve web content."
